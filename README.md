# Holiday Greeting Card Backing

This is essentially a backing sheet for my 2022 holiday greeting card. A
3D printed [lithophane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithophane) was attached
to the card.

I'm distributing this because it contains a couple of useful graphics routines
in Asymptote, which might be useful to someone:

- A simple line construction of evergreen trees
- Randomized snow
- Hills
- A window
